## INST 326 Final Project: COVID-19 Tracker <br>

Team Members: Kristen Wagner, Chandra Tamang, Minsung Kim, Diego Amores

## Introduction:

Our team has built a COVID-19 Tracker command-line interface to make users' lives a little easier during this global pandemic. Our interface allows users to get the latest COVID-19 information in various ways. It has many different functions built for our users. By using our interactive command-line, users can get the number of deaths for each state, the number of total cases by specific dates, the number of cases reported, see COVID-19 data visually, and so on.
