class Covid:

    Covid class have 8 different functions, and all of the functions have different purposes.
    positivity_rate()
        This function will prompt users and base on users input, it will print out positivity rate,
        letter grade for state, and so on. It also store users input, and it can be later read by users.
    send_message()
        This function will send users friends message if users experienced symptoms of covid,
        or tested positive for covid.
    askUsers(self)
        This function promt users and their inputs will be stored in a Person object
        that holds each indiviual person.
    readFileAndStore()
        This function will read patients file.
        Display the results and store them in individual Person objects in our dictionary.
    reg_data()
        This function will use regular expression to group data about covid such as state, number of deaths,
        and number of tested positives, and number of tested negatives.
    graph()
        This function will use values from reg_data function to visualize data,
        and then it will display the results.
    CaseDensity()
        This function will caculate covid density of each state and covid density of each state per day,
        and month. The total population of each state/ total cases of each each = Covid density
        Covid density shows how dangerous each states actually are. 
    dailyMonthly()
        This function will calculate the sum of cases each day, and each month
        Calculate how many more/less people got infected than previous day/month

        This function will prompt the user for a state and will read a csv file, then output 
        the total number of covid cases in that state thus far, the current active cases, and the 
        incident rate, which is the number of new cases per day divided by a population of 1,000 people.
